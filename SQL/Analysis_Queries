--QUESTION 4: Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers
ALTER TABLE [KMS Sql Case Study 1]
ADD REVENUE MONEY;

UPDATE [KMS Sql Case Study 1]

--ADVICE AS A DATA ANALYST TO KMS ON HOW TO INCREASE REVENUE FROM BOTTOM 10 CUSTOMERS
--Analysis of the bottom 1o customers shows that many placed critical orders but recieved them via Regular Air instead of Express Air, risking delays or damage of product. This may likely contibute to customer dissatisfaction.This customers also just made 1 or 2 order purchase between 2009-2012, this product falls under OFFICE SUPPLIES under product category
-- which are typically urgent. This low revenue may be linked to poor delivery experiences  and unmet expectations.

--RECOMENDATIONS:
--1. Allign shipping mode to order priority: use Express Air for critical orders to improve delivery speed and satisfaction
--2. Improve Customer Experience for Office Supplies category: Review the delivery feedbacks and timelines for office supplies orders and evaluate if delays or damages have affected customer retention
--3. Re-engage inactive customers: Investigate thier experiences and address delivery concerns
--4. Automate shipping logic: Allign shipping method with product type and priority. Implement a rule based shipping logic where product category + order priority dictates the most suitable shipping method automatically.

--QUESTION 5: KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

--QUESTION 11: If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority?

	AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, Order_Date, Ship_Date)) AS AVG_SHIP_DAYS 
FROM [KMS Sql Case Study 1]
GROUP BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode DESC

---REPORT
--The Company is not spending Apropraitely based on shipping cost with order priority.
--1. critical goods should be sent with Express air. Using delivery truck or regular air to deliver the good under critical priority is at risk for late deliveries and damage which could cause customer dissatisfaction and refrain them from purchasing again. Saving on cost at the expense of service quality.
--2. the goods under low priority should be delivered through delivery truck, but from the data it is mostly delivered by regular air which can be seen as overspending, no cost effectiveness.KMS should use delivery truck to deliver low priority good so as to minimize shipping cost for non urgent deliveries

 --RECOMMENDATION
 -- Use express air for critical and some high priority orders
 --Use regular air for high priority orders
 -- Use delivery truck for low priority orders
 --this will help the company spend appropraitely on shipping cost base on order priority.
